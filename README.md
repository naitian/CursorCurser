# CursorCurser
Cursor Curser is a chrome extension that fills up your screen with a random obscenity every time you click.

## Installation
For the time being, there are no plans to publish this extension on the chrome web store. To use this extension, clone this repository using

```bash
git clone https://github.com/naitian/CursorCurser.git
```

Then open chrome and type `chrome://extensions` into the address bar. Check "Developer Mode" in the top right corner of the screen, and click on "Load unpacked extension...". Navigate to and select the CursorCurser directory. Then make sure that Cursor Curser is enabled by checking the "Enabled" box.
