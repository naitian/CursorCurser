# CursorCurser
Cursor Curser is a chrome extension that fills up your screen with a random obscenity every time you click.

##Installation
For the time being, there are no plans to publish this extension on the chrome web store. To use this extension, clone this repository using
```bash
git clone https://github.com/naitian/CursorCurser.git
```

Then open chrome and type `chrome://extensions` into the address bar. Check "Developer Mode" in the top right corner of the screen, and click on "Load unpacked extension...". Navigate to and select the CursorCurser directory. Then make sure that Cursor Curser is enabled by checking the "Enabled" box.

##To Contribute
This is a very simple project, and adding on to it is extremely easy.
####Contributing Swears
Add more swears by adding on to the `curseAr` array inside script.js. Please try to keep the curses more fun(ny) than offensive.

##Todo:
- [ ] Move the curses array to a separate json file.
- [ ] Add colors to the screen fill.
- [ ] Add smoother animations to the screen fill.
